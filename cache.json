          "description": "这篇文章将描述代码中经常使用的抢占式接口模式，以及为什么我认为在 Go 中遵循这种模式通常是不正确的。\n什么是抢占式接口\n接口是一种描述行为的方式，存在于大多数类型语言中。抢占式接口是指开发人员在实际需要出现之前对接口进行编码。一个示例可能如下所示。\ntype Auth interface {\n  GetUser() (User, error)\n}\n\ntype authImpl struct {\n  // ...\n}\nfunc NewAuth() Auth {\n  return &authImpl\n}\n\n抢占式接口何时有用\n抢占接口通常用于在 Java 中,并且大获成功，这是大部分程序员的想法。相信，很多 Go 开发者也是这么认为的。这种用法主要区别在于 Java 具有显式接口，而 Go 是隐式接口。让我们看一些示例 Java 代码，这些代码显示了如果不使用 Java 中的抢占式接口可能会出现的困难。\n// auth.java\npublic class Auth {\n  public boolean canAction() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n// logic.java\npublic class Logic {\n  public void takeAction(Auth a) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n现在假设您要更改 Logic 的 takeAction 方法中的参数 Auth 类型的对象，只要它具有 canAction() 方法即可。不幸的是，你不能。Auth 没有在其中实现带有 canAction() 的接口。你现在必须修改 Auth 为其提供一个接口，然后您可以在 takeAction 中接受该接口，或者将 Auth 包装在一个除了实现的方法之外什么都不做的类中。即使 logic.java 定义了一个 Auth 接口以在 takeAction() 中接受，也可能很难让 Auth 实现该接口。您可能无权修改 Auth，或者 Auth 可能位于第三方库中。也许 Auth 的作者不同意你的修改。也许在代码库中与同事共享 Auth，现在需要在修改之前达成共识。这是希望的 Java 代码。\n// auth.java\npublic interface Auth {\n  public boolean canAction()\n}\n// authimpl.java\nclass AuthImpl implements Auth {\n}\n// logic.java\npublic class Logic {\n  public void takeAction(Auth a) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n如果 Auth 的作者最初编码并返回一个接口，那么你在尝试扩展 takeAction 时，永远不会遇到问题。它自然适用于任何 Auth 接口。在具有显式接口的语言中，以后你会感谢过去的自己使用了抢占式接口。\n为什么这在 Go 中不是问题\n让我们在 Go 中设置相同的情况。\n// auth.go \ntype Auth struct { \n// ... \n}\n// logic.go \nfunc TakeAction(a *Auth) { \n  // ... \n}\n\n如果 logic 想要使 TakeAction 通用，则 logic 所有者可以单方面执行此操作，而不会打扰其他人。\n// logic.go \ntype LogicAuth interface { \n  CanAction() bool \n}\nfunc TakeAction(a LogicAuth) { \n  // ... \n}\n\n请注意 auth.go 不需要更改。这是使抢占式接口不再需要的关键所在。\nGo 中抢占式接口的意外副作用\nGo 的接口定义都是很小，但很强大。在标准库中，大多数接口定义都是单一方法。这允许最大的重用，因为实现接口很容易。当程序员对像上面的 Auth 这样的抢占式接口进行编码时，接口的方法数量往往会激增，这使得接口（可交换实现）的全部意义更难以实现。\nGo 中接口的最佳用法\nGo 的一个很好的经验法则是 - 接受接口，返回结构体。接受接口为您的 API 提供了最大的灵活性，返回结构体允许调用者快速导航到正确的函数。\n即使你的 Go 代码接受结构体并返回结构体以启动，隐式接口也允许您稍后扩展你的 API，而不会破坏向后兼容性。接口是一种抽象，抽象有时很有用。然而，不必要的抽象会造成不必要的复杂化。在需要之前不要使代码过于复杂。",

          "description": "作者｜ 修冶\n背 景\n​\n微服务在最近几年大行其道，很多公司的研发人员都在考虑微服务架构，同时，随着 Docker 容器技术和自动化运维等相关技术发展，微服务变得更容易管理，这给了微服务架构良好的发展机会。\n​\n在做微服务的路上，拆分服务是个很热的话题。我们应该按照什么原则将现有的业务进行拆分？是否拆分得越细就越好？接下来一起谈谈服务拆分的策略和坚持的原则。\n​\n拆分目的是什么？\n​\n在介绍如何拆分之前，我们需要了解下拆分的目的是什么，这样才不会在后续的拆分过程中忘了最初的目的。\n​\n拆分的本质是为了将复杂的问题简单化，那么我们在单体架构阶段遇到了哪些复杂性问题呢？首先来回想下当初为什么选用了单体架构，在电商项目刚启动的时候，我们只希望能尽快地将项目搭建起来，方便将产品更早的投放市场进行快速验证。在开发初期，这种架构确实给开发和运维带来了很大的便捷，主要体现在：\n​\n开发简单直接，代码和项目集中式管理。\n排查问题时只需要排查这个应用就可以了，更有针对性。\n只需要维护一个工程，节省维护系统运行的人力成本。\n但是随着功能越来越多，开发团队的规模越来越大，单体架构的缺陷慢慢体现出来，主要有以下几个方面：\n​\n在技术层面，数据库的连接数成为应用服务器扩容的瓶颈，因为连接 MySQL 的客户端数量是有限制的。\n​\n除此之外，单体架构增加了研发的成本抑制了研发效率的提升。比如公司的垂直电商系统团队会被按业务线拆分为不同的组。当如此多的小团队共同维护一套代码和一个系统时，在配合的过程中就会出现问题。不同的团队之间沟通少，假如一个团队需要一个发送短信的功能，那么有的研发同学会认为最快的方式不是询问其他团队是否有现成的，而是自己写一套，但是这种想法是不合适的，会造成功能服务的重复开发。由于代码部署在一起，每个人都向同一个代码库提交代码，代码冲突无法避免；同时功能之间耦合严重，可能你只是更改了…",

          "description": "作者：赵禹光，Seata Contributor，SkyWalking PMC\n​\n背景前序\n​\n\n正如所看到的文章题目，就在此时，Seata 与 SkyWalking 两个生态融合,取得了阶段性成果。下面就结合文章内容，给你徐徐道来。\n​\n事情的起因是这样的，Seata、SkyWalking 分别是分布式事务领域、一站式 APM 领域的的佼佼者，这一点通过 Github Star 排名就可以知道，也就不再赘述了。所以早在 2019 年，Seata 的用户就提出了使用 SkyWalking 观测的诉求。\n​\nSeata 融入 SkyWalking 监控后，就有了 APM 特性，用户在定位 Seata 分布式事务的问题时，可以通过分布式链路、机器指标、日志内容等多个维度进行问题剖析，实现定位问题的提效。\n​\n那结合这个诉求，两个社区感兴趣的同学就开始展开了初步讨论和实践，但是由于当时 Seata 的传输协议中，没有类似于 HTTP Header 的面向传输的消息头部，所以实现的第一版虽然实现了监控观测，但是兼容性非常不友好，这在解决分布式事务的监控中，显然是有欠缺的。故此，我们开启了二番讨论，结论是兼容性的前置条件是必须的，所以，Seata 要实现传输协议升级，就此 Seata 将此事放在了 RoadMap 中。SkyWalking 社区这边也暂时搁置了这件事。\n​\n时光荏苒，转眼 1 年多就过去了，Seata 社区在过程中已经完成了传输协议的升级，那我们就重启此事。\n​\n一、Seata 接入 SkyWalking 后，用户得到了什么\n​\n\n背景已经叙述完了，由于时间有些久，可能大家对两个生态融合之后带来的效果，也不是很清晰了，这里就我的个人的理解，介绍下两个生态融合后，给用户带来的益处：\n​\nSeata 的性能可被更好的观测:\n​\n\n我看到很多 Seata 分享的时候都有用户提问，Seata 性能消耗数据，因为分布式事务的性能消耗与场景关系非常大，所以用户通过 SkyWalking 可以更简单的观测自己的场景，自己给自己答案。\n​\n分布式事务执行过程有痕迹\n​\n\n在 AT 模式下，Seata 通过面向传输的消息头部，传递全局事务 XID ，全局事务执行完成后，每个在 DB 中的执行过程都会被清理掉，这在回溯执行过程的时候非常不友好，这些海量数据 Seata 可不会存储，这严重增加分布式事务关联数据库表的空间，带来不必要的性能消耗。所以两个生态融合后，SkyWalking 相关的数据库监控，就可以记录这些执行过程的海量数据。\n​\n定位问题的提效\n在日志中打印 XID 的同时打印 TraceId ，当出现问题想回溯 XID 相关联的全局链路时，在 SkyWalking 的展示端输入 TraceId 即可，通过 Seata 整体监控融入 SkyWalking ，不仅拥有全链路领域的监控，还在仪表盘、拓扑图、在线剖析和报警都得到了监控。\n​\n入门 Seata 提高一个维度\n​\n\n分布式事务一直被炒得很热，但真正能在市场上落地的也只有 Seata ，所以 Seata 并没有开源的学习范本，所以快速带领大家入门的资料也比较少。而且 Seata 有 3 个角色、4 种经典模式，可以多种组合，综上所诉，不由得让使用者云里雾里，两个生态融合后，用户可以清晰从上帝 (监控) 知道 Seata 的执行过程，进而透析工作原理。\n​\n二、典型 AT 模式监控场景\n​\n\n下面就官方 AT 模式的 Demo ，展示下接入后的 APM 特性。\n​\n官方描述的 ToC 交易场景\n用户请求交易服务\n交易服务锁定库存\n交易服务创建账单\n账单服务进行扣款\n​\n\n\n当 Seata 与 SkyWalking 融合后，场景复原\n\n全局事务正常链路描述\n​\n\n\n\n​\n全局事务异常链路描述\n​\n\n\n\n​\n用户手册\n官网\nSkyWalking APM: \nhttp://seata.io/zh-cn/docs/user/apm/skywalking.html\n常用链接\nSeata:  https://github.com/seata/seata\nSamples:  https://github.com/seata/seata-samples\nRelease:  https://github.com/seata/seata/releases\n官网:  https://seata.io\n​\n投稿\n欢迎大家将 Seata 相关的实践文章投稿至：slievrly@gmail.com\n​",

Serverless 服务引擎 - Serving\n​\n\nKnative Serving 核心能力就是其简洁、高效的应用托管服务，这也是其支撑 Serverless 能力的基础。当然作为 Serverless Framework 就离不开按需分配资源的能力，Knative 可以根据应用的请求量在高峰时期自动扩容实例数，当请求量减少以后自动缩容实例数，可以非常自动化地帮助您节省成本。\n​\nServing 还提供了流量管理能力和灵活的灰度发布能力。流量管理能力可以根据百分比切分流量，灰度发布能力可以根据流量百分比进行灰度。\n​\n1）简单的应用模型\n​\n\n提供了极简的应用模型 - Knative Service ，同时满足服务部署、服务访问以及灰度发布的能力。可以用下面的公式表述：Knative Service = 工作负载（Deployment）+ 服务访问（ Service ）+ 灰度流量（ Ingress ）。\n​\n应用模型如下图\n\nService：对 Serverless…",
