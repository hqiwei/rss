          "description": "作者：童牧\n绪论\n在基于 Percolator 提交协议的分布式数据库被提出的时期，学术研究上还出现了一种叫确定性数据库的技术，在这项技术的发展过程中也出现了各种流派。本文将讲解学术上不同的确定性事务和特点，并综合说说他们的优点和面临的问题。\n本文将按照提出的顺序进行讲解：\n确定性数据库的定义；\n\n\n可扩展的确定性数据库 Calvin；\n\n\n基于依赖分析的确定性数据库 BOHM & PWV；\n\n\n重视实践的确定性数据库 Aria。\n\n\n确定性数据库的定义\n确定性数据库的确定性指的是执行结果的确定性，一言蔽之，给定一个事务输入集合，数据库执行后能有唯一的结果。\n\n图 1 - 不存在偏序关系时的不确定性\n但是这一确定性是需要基于偏序关系的，偏序关系代表的是事务在数据库系统中执行的先后顺序。图 1 中，两个事务并发执行，但是还没有被确认偏序关系，那么这两个事务的执行先后顺序还没有被确定，因此这两个事务的执行顺序也是自由的，而不同的执行顺序则会带来不同的结果。\n\n图 2 - 使用事务管理器为排序输入事务排序\n图 1 中的例子说明，为了达到确定性的结果，在事务执行前，我们就需要对其进行排序，图 2 中加入了一个事务管理器，在事务被执行前，会从事务管理器之中申请一个 id，全局的事务执行可以看作是按照 id 顺序进行的，图中 T2 读到了 T1 的写入结果，T3 读到了 T2 的写入结果，因此这三个事务必须按照 T1 -> T2 -> T3 的顺序执行才能产生正确的结果。\n\n图 3 - 死锁的产生\n确定性数据库的另一个优点在于能够规避死锁的产生，死锁的产生原因是交互式的事务有中间过程，图 3 是对产生过程的解释，T1 和 T2 各写入一个 Key，随后在 T1 尝试写入 T2 的 Key，T2 尝试写入 T1 的 Key 时就产生了死锁，需要 abort 其中的一个事务。设想一下如果事…",

          "description": "推荐 gorilla/sessions 的背景\n在日常 Web 应用开发过程中，需要对用户登录状态进行判断，而 HTTP 是无状态的，即不记录用户登录状态，想要得到用户登录状态得把登录状态保存下来，通常用户状态数据加密后用数据库或者缓存等手段把存储；原生的会话数据存储的 HTTP cookie 对数据大小有限制，不能写入太多太大的数据，又不能对存储的数据进行有效管理，而 gorilla/sessions 恰恰补充了原生回话控制的不足。\ngorilla/sessions 简介\ngorilla/sessions 支持原生的 HTTP cookie 会话数据存储和存储介质系统会话以及自定义会话等基础设施（Memcache/Redis/SQLite/MySQL ）的支持应有尽有。\ngorilla/sessions 提供了会话数据的加密解密，以及底层的 cookie 管理，提供的接口比较简单易用，gorilla/sessions 主要特点如下：\n简单的 API：使用它作为设置签名（和可选的加密）cookie 的简单方法。\n内置的后端可以在 cookie 或文件系统中存储会话。\nFlash 信息：会话值持续到读取为止。\n切换会话持久性（又称 \"记住我\"）和设置其他属性的方便方法。\n轮换认证和加密密钥的机制。\n每个请求有多个会话，甚至使用不同的后端。\n自定义会话后端的接口和基础设施：来自不同端的会话可以使用一个共同的 API 进行检索和批量保存。\ngorilla/sessions 应用\n下面是集成 gorilla/sessions 的简单会话控制业务代码段，如下：\nimport (\n    \"github.com/gorilla/sessions\"\n    \"net/http\"\n    \"os\"\n)\n\n// Store gorilla sessions 的存储库\nvar Store = …",

          "description": "dubbogo 项目已进入第六个年头。dubbogo 项目初期的使命就是 \"bridging the gap between Java and Go\" ，目前 dubbogo 已经对齐所有 dubbo 版本，正与 Dubbo 齐头并进，并在云原生方向反哺 Dubbo。\n参与过 dubbogo 项目跟着社区一路走来的人，有贡献者 100 多人，apache dubbo committer 23 人，其中 PMC 5 人。社区基础项目在 https://github.com/dubbogo，孵化成熟后即捐献到 https://github.com/apache，已经总体给 apache 组织贡献了 5 个 项目，整体代码有 17 万行之多。\n从本期开始，本账号将陆续采访社区的 PMC/committer，回首各位同学加入社区时的初心，回忆在社区成长的朝朝暮暮，以照亮未来在社区的前行路。\n\n1. 首先回忆下是什么契机让你了解到 dubbogo 的？\n最初了解到 dubbogo 是在携程的时候需要为公司的 go 语言内部社区寻找一个可以跟 java 生态打通的 go 语言服务框架，于是就全网找到了当时于雨贡献的 dubbo-go 项目。dubbo-go 是当时唯一可以通过 hessian2 协议与 java 进行互通的项目，与我们的需求相符。\n2. 参与到 dubbogo 的开源贡献是什么样的体验？\n我有幸参与到 dubbogo 1.0 版本的重构建设过程，该版本后面正式捐献给 apache，感受到了于雨、北纬等这帮技术人们的坚持和热爱。在过程中收获了很多的技术也包括开源认知、协作方面的成长。对我后续从事架构和开源方面的工作有很深的影响。\n3. 支撑你持续贡献 dubbogo 最大的动力，以及给 dubbogo 做出的最大贡献是什么？\n开源的动力热爱肯定是第一位的，没有热爱就做不成这件事情。当时在参与重构 1.0 版本的时候，真的是工作时间和休息时间都在写代码，都在思考怎么让程序扩展性更强、性能更优化。我做的最大的贡献就是跟另一位同事，实操了 1.0 版本的整个架构重构和服务框架层代码重写，以及在贡献给 apache 之后的一段时间内，参与后续版本的技术规划和组织社区活动。\n4. 贡献中遇到最大的挑战是什么，后面社区给你什么帮助？\n最大的挑战其实是重构的难度和维护的压力，当时现有的一个版本离 dubbo 完善的 java 语言版本还是有很大的一块距离，dubbo 有完善的服务治理能力、与各个社区兼容的繁荣生态和非常大的用户群体，要实现与 java 版本的完全兼容和互通还是比较有难度的。开源之后项目有比较大的曝光，有许多公司慢慢用起来了，又有很多坑和 bug 要解决，这段时间是有比较大的压力的。\n5. 成为 PMC 后，你对 dubbogo 未来是期待是什么？\n\n希望 dubbogo 后续在 go 语言微服务体系与云原生这条路上能走的更远，也希望有这类需求的企业和感兴趣的同学能够参与进来，希望 dubbogo 项目能对中国的 go 语言开源生态产生影响力。\n6. 还有在参与 dubbo/dubbogo 社区或者其他阿里开源社区中的其他开源项目吗？\n暂时没有参与阿里开源社区的其他项目。\n何鑫铭，前携程基础中台研发部技术专家，现蚂蚁金服支付中台基础资金平台技术组高级技术专家。专注于 Go & Java、中台架构、中间件与区块链等技术\n欢迎加入 dubbo-go 社区\n钉钉群:23331795",

          "description": "本文基于 Go 1.13。这里讨论的关于内存管理的概念在我的文章Go:内存管理和分配 中有解释\nGo 垃圾回收器负责回收不再使用的内存。实现的算法是一个并行的三色标记扫描采集器。在本文中，我们将详细了解标记阶段，以及不同颜色的用法。\n您可以在 kenfox 的可视化垃圾回收算法 中找到关于不同类型垃圾回收器的更多信息。\n标记阶段\n此阶段执行内存扫描，以了解代码仍在使用哪些块，以及应该回收哪些块。\n但是，由于垃圾回收器可以与我们的 Go 程序同时运行，因此它需要一种在扫描时检测内存中潜在变化的方法。为了解决这个潜在的问题，实现了一个写屏障算法，允许 Go 跟踪任何指针的变化。启用写屏障的唯一条件是短时间停止程序，也称为 “STW”：\n\n在进程开始时，Go 还会为每个处理器启动一个标记辅助进程，以帮助标记内存。\n然后，一旦根节点被排队等待处理，标记阶段就可以开始遍历内存并为其着色。\n现在让我们以一个简单的程序为例，该程序允许我们遵循标记阶段所做的步骤\nType struct1 struct {\n    a, b int64\n    c, d float64\n    e *struct2\n}\n\ntype struct2 struct {\n    f, g int64\n    h, i float64\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    s1 := allocStruct1()\n    s2 := allocStruct2()\n\n    func () {\n        _ = allocStruct2()\n    }()\n\n    runtime.GC()\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"s1 = %X, s2 = %X\\n\", &s1, &s2)\n}\n\n//go:noinline\nfunc allocStruct1() *struct1 {\n    return &struct1{\n        e: allocStruct2(),\n    }\n}\n\n//go:noinline\nfunc allocStruct2() *struct2 {\n    return &struct2{}\n}\n\n由于 struct subStruct 不包含任何指针，因此它存储在一个专用于对象的范围中，而不引用其他对象：\n\n这使得垃圾回收器的工作更容易，因为它在标记内存时不必扫描这个范围。\n一旦分配完成，我们的程序就会强制垃圾回收器运行一个周期。以下是工作流程：\n\n垃圾回收器从堆栈开始标记，然后跟着指针递归遍历内存。直到对象都被标记时停止扫描。然而，这个过程不是在同一个 goroutine 中完成的\n完成的；每个指针都在工作池中排队。然后 ，后台的标记线程发现之前的出列队列是来自该工作池，扫描对象，然后将在其中找到的指针加入队列：\n\n着色!\n后台线程现在需要一种方法来跟踪哪些内存有没有被扫描。垃圾回收器使用三色算法，其工作原理如下：\n所有对象一开始都被认为是白色的\n\n\n根对象（堆栈、堆、全局变量）将以灰色显示\n\n\n\n完成此主要步骤后，垃圾回收器将：\n选择一个灰色的对象，把它涂成黑色\n\n\n遵循此对象的所有指针并将所有引用的对象涂成灰色\n\n\n\n然后，它将重复这两个步骤，直到没有更多的对象要着色。从这一点来看，对象不是黑色就是白色。白色集合表示未被任何其他对象引用且准备好回收的对象。\n下面是使用上一个示例对其进行的表示：\n\n作为第一种状态，所有对象都被视为白色。然后，对象被遍历，可到达的对象将变为灰色。如果对象位于标记为 “无扫描” 的范围内，则可以将其绘制为黑色，因为不需要对其进行扫描：\n\n灰色对象现在入队等待扫描并变黑：\n\n在没有更多的对象要处理之前，入队的对象也会发生同样的情况：\n\n在进程结束时，黑色对象是内存中正在使用的对象，而白色对象是要回收的对象。如我们所见，由于 struct2 的实例是在匿名函数中创建的，并且无法从堆栈访问，因此它保持为白色，可以清除。\n由于每个跨度中有一个名为 gcmarkBits 的位图属性，颜色在内部实现，该属性跟踪扫描，并将相应的位设置为 1：\n\n正如我们所见，黑色和灰色的工作原理是一样的。这一过程的不同之处在于，当黑色对象结束扫描链时，灰色对象排队等待扫描。\n垃圾回收器最终会 stops the world，将每个写屏障上所做的更改刷新到工作池，并执行剩余的标记。\n您可以在我的文章Go:垃圾回收器如何监视您的应用程序 中找到有关并发进程和垃圾回收器中标记阶段的更多详细信息\n运行时分析器\nGo 提供的工具允许我们可视化所有这些步骤，并在程序中查看垃圾回收器的影响。在启用跟踪的情况下运行我们的代码提供了前面步骤的一个大图。以下是 traces：\n\n标记线程的生命周期也可以在 goroutine 级别的 tracer 中可视化。下面是 goroutine#33 的示例，它在开始标记内存之前先在后台等待。",

          "description": "这篇文章将描述代码中经常使用的抢占式接口模式，以及为什么我认为在 Go 中遵循这种模式通常是不正确的。\n什么是抢占式接口\n接口是一种描述行为的方式，存在于大多数类型语言中。抢占式接口是指开发人员在实际需要出现之前对接口进行编码。一个示例可能如下所示。\ntype Auth interface {\n  GetUser() (User, error)\n}\n\ntype authImpl struct {\n  // ...\n}\nfunc NewAuth() Auth {\n  return &authImpl\n}\n\n抢占式接口何时有用\n抢占接口通常用于在 Java 中,并且大获成功，这是大部分程序员的想法。相信，很多 Go 开发者也是这么认为的。这种用法主要区别在于 Java 具有显式接口，而 Go 是隐式接口。让我们看一些示例 Java 代码，这些代码显示了如果不使用 Java 中的抢占式接口可能会出现的困难。\n// auth.java\npublic class Auth {\n  public boolean canAction() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n// logic.java\npublic class Logic {\n  public void takeAction(Auth a) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n现在假设您要更改 Logic 的 takeAction 方法中的参数 Auth 类型的对象，只要它具有 canAction() 方法即可。不幸的是，你不能。Auth 没有在其中实现带有 canAction() 的接口。你现在必须修改 Auth 为其提供一个接口，然后您可以在 takeAction 中接受该接口，或者将 Auth 包装在一个除了实现的方法之外什么都不做的类中。即使 logic.java 定义了一个 Auth 接口以在 takeAction() 中接受，也可能很难让 Auth 实现该接口。您可能无权修改 Auth，或者 Auth 可能位于第三方库中。也许 Auth 的作者不同意你的修改。也许在代码库中与同事共享 Auth，现在需要在修改之前达成共识。这是希望的 Java 代码。\n// auth.java\npublic interface Auth {\n  public boolean canAction()\n}\n// authimpl.java\nclass AuthImpl implements Auth {\n}\n// logic.java\npublic class Logic {\n  public void takeAction(Auth a) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n如果 Auth 的作者最初编码并返回一个接口，那么你在尝试扩展 takeAction 时，永远不会遇到问题。它自然适用于任何 Auth 接口。在具有显式接口的语言中，以后你会感谢过去的自己使用了抢占式接口。\n为什么这在 Go 中不是问题\n让我们在 Go 中设置相同的情况。\n// auth.go \ntype Auth struct { \n// ... \n}\n// logic.go \nfunc TakeAction(a *Auth) { \n  // ... \n}\n\n如果 logic 想要使 TakeAction 通用，则 logic 所有者可以单方面执行此操作，而不会打扰其他人。\n// logic.go \ntype LogicAuth interface { \n  CanAction() bool \n}\nfunc TakeAction(a LogicAuth) { \n  // ... \n}\n\n请注意 auth.go 不需要更改。这是使抢占式接口不再需要的关键所在。\nGo 中抢占式接口的意外副作用\nGo 的接口定义都是很小，但很强大。在标准库中，大多数接口定义都是单一方法。这允许最大的重用，因为实现接口很容易。当程序员对像上面的 Auth 这样的抢占式接口进行编码时，接口的方法数量往往会激增，这使得接口（可交换实现）的全部意义更难以实现。\nGo 中接口的最佳用法\nGo 的一个很好的经验法则是 - 接受接口，返回结构体。接受接口为您的 API 提供了最大的灵活性，返回结构体允许调用者快速导航到正确的函数。\n即使你的 Go 代码接受结构体并返回结构体以启动，隐式接口也允许您稍后扩展你的 API，而不会破坏向后兼容性。接口是一种抽象，抽象有时很有用。然而，不必要的抽象会造成不必要的复杂化。在需要之前不要使代码过于复杂。",

          "description": "作者｜ 修冶\n背 景\n​\n微服务在最近几年大行其道，很多公司的研发人员都在考虑微服务架构，同时，随着 Docker 容器技术和自动化运维等相关技术发展，微服务变得更容易管理，这给了微服务架构良好的发展机会。\n​\n在做微服务的路上，拆分服务是个很热的话题。我们应该按照什么原则将现有的业务进行拆分？是否拆分得越细就越好？接下来一起谈谈服务拆分的策略和坚持的原则。\n​\n拆分目的是什么？\n​\n在介绍如何拆分之前，我们需要了解下拆分的目的是什么，这样才不会在后续的拆分过程中忘了最初的目的。\n​\n拆分的本质是为了将复杂的问题简单化，那么我们在单体架构阶段遇到了哪些复杂性问题呢？首先来回想下当初为什么选用了单体架构，在电商项目刚启动的时候，我们只希望能尽快地将项目搭建起来，方便将产品更早的投放市场进行快速验证。在开发初期，这种架构确实给开发和运维带来了很大的便捷，主要体现在：\n​\n开发简单直接，代码和项目集中式管理。\n排查问题时只需要排查这个应用就可以了，更有针对性。\n只需要维护一个工程，节省维护系统运行的人力成本。\n但是随着功能越来越多，开发团队的规模越来越大，单体架构的缺陷慢慢体现出来，主要有以下几个方面：\n​\n在技术层面，数据库的连接数成为应用服务器扩容的瓶颈，因为连接 MySQL 的客户端数量是有限制的。\n​\n除此之外，单体架构增加了研发的成本抑制了研发效率的提升。比如公司的垂直电商系统团队会被按业务线拆分为不同的组。当如此多的小团队共同维护一套代码和一个系统时，在配合的过程中就会出现问题。不同的团队之间沟通少，假如一个团队需要一个发送短信的功能，那么有的研发同学会认为最快的方式不是询问其他团队是否有现成的，而是自己写一套，但是这种想法是不合适的，会造成功能服务的重复开发。由于代码部署在一起，每个人都向同一个代码库提交代码，代码冲突无法避免；同时功能之间耦合严重，可能你只是更改了…",
