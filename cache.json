          "description": "UI 优先的统一身份认证系统 Casdoor\nCasdoor 是 Casbin 社区的开源项目，仓库地址：Casdoor\nCasdoor 是什么\nCasdoor 是一个基于 OAuth 2.0 / OIDC 的 UI 优先集中认证 / 单点登录 (SSO) 平台，简单点说，就是 Casdoor 可以帮你解决 用户管理 的难题，你无需开发用户登录注册等与用户鉴权相关的一系列功能，只需几个步骤，简单配置，与你的主应用配合，便可完全托管你的用户模块，简单省心，功能强大。\nCasdoor 目前作为 Casbin 社区项目统一使用的鉴权平台，项目已开源，希望得到大家的一些建议和 Star~，我们会及时跟进反馈并改正问题哒。\n为什么要用 Casdoor\n用户管理一直是项目中非常令人头疼的一个问题，不仅要确保安全性，功能是否完整，方便使用也十分重要。目前大多数应用已从过去单一的账号密码登录，逐渐升级为允许通过第三方平台登录，例如 GitHub、微信、QQ 等。但是这一套逻辑依然需要开发者去实现，大多数功能偏离了业务。\nCasdoor 就是替开发者们解决这个难题，即 提供一套统一的鉴权平台，只需要简单配置便可完全托管用户模块。\n使用的理由也非常简单，总结概括为三句话：\n功能完备，操作简单。作为一个需要完全托管用户模块的项目，功能完备必不可少，Casdoor 支持常见用户模块所需要的各种功能。并且配置简单，上手难度低。\n开源可控，社区活跃。能否快速得到社区的反馈，解决实际应用中出现的问题也十分重要，否则出了 Bug 没人管岂不是尴尬？Casdoor 有自己的讨论社区 Casnode，也有 QQ 群，均可及时活跃地解决实际应用中的问题。\n性能强大，耦合良好。采用 Golang 开发，并发性支持良好，并且内部模块耦合度低，代码易懂，热插拔性好。\nCasdoor 又有哪些特性\n支持普通的账户密码注册登录，也支持各种常见的第三方认证，例如 GitHub、Facebook、Google、Wechat、QQ、LinkedIn 等等，截止目前共 9 个平台，并在不断听取用户建议对更多的平台提供支持。\n管理方便。Casdoor 内部将模块分为了 5 大类，Organization、User、Application、Token 和 Provider。可以同时接入多个组织，组织下有不同应用，用户可以通过应用或组织分类，单独管理任何组织、应用或用户的 Token 令牌，轻松管理复杂系统，目前已部署在 Casbin 社区各种系统当作鉴权平台。\n自定义程度高。Casdoor 可以随意修改登录方式，例如是否允许密码或第三方登录，自定义应用的注册项数量，是否启用两步验证，以及是否允许各个 Provider 登录、注册等等，高度可插拔。\n具备 Swagger API 文档。清晰的 API 介绍，无需阅读源代码即可直接方便调用各个 API 接口，提供定制化功能。\n前后端分离架构，部署简单。作为统一认证平台，除了性能，稳定性，新特性之外，易用性也是考量的重要标准，Casdoor 后端使用 Golang 语言开发，前端使用 React.js 框架，使用者只需启动后端服务，并将前端工程文件打包，即可直接使用，操作简单，上手难度低。\n...\n总结\n我们希望 Casdoor 能帮助广大开发者们解决用户管理的难题，更专注主要业务，提高开发效率。\n同时作为一个开源项目，我们也非常希望获得大家的使用建议，帮助我们更好地改善项目质量，从功能、易用性等方面更好地满足大家的需求。\n如果使用过程中有任何疑问，欢迎加入社区 QQ 群交流，或者在 Casnode 论坛发帖，提 Issues。当然，提 PR 也是十分欢迎的！\nCasnode 论坛地址：Casnode\n\n\nQQ 群：645200447",

          "description": "本文基于 Go 1.13。这里讨论的关于内存管理的概念在我的文章Go:内存管理和分配 中有解释\nGo 垃圾回收器负责回收不再使用的内存。实现的算法是一个并行的三色标记扫描采集器。在本文中，我们将详细了解标记阶段，以及不同颜色的用法。\n您可以在 kenfox 的可视化垃圾回收算法 中找到关于不同类型垃圾回收器的更多信息。\n标记阶段\n此阶段执行内存扫描，以了解代码仍在使用哪些块，以及应该回收哪些块。\n但是，由于垃圾回收器可以与我们的 Go 程序同时运行，因此它需要一种在扫描时检测内存中潜在变化的方法。为了解决这个潜在的问题，实现了一个写屏障算法，允许 Go 跟踪任何指针的变化。启用写屏障的唯一条件是短时间停止程序，也称为 “STW”：\n\n在进程开始时，Go 还会为每个处理器启动一个标记辅助进程，以帮助标记内存。\n然后，一旦根节点被排队等待处理，标记阶段就可以开始遍历内存并为其着色。\n现在让我们以一个简单的程序为例，该程序允许我们遵循标记阶段所做的步骤\nType struct1 struct {\n    a, b int64\n    c, d float64\n    e *struct2\n}\n\ntype struct2 struct {\n    f, g int64\n    h, i float64\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    s1 := allocStruct1()\n    s2 := allocStruct2()\n\n    func () {\n        _ = allocStruct2()\n    }()\n\n    runtime.GC()\n\n    fmt.Printf(\"s1 = %X, s2 = %X\\n\", &s1, &s2)\n}\n\n//go:noinline\nfunc allocStruct1() *struct1 {\n    return &struct1{\n        e: allocStruct2(),\n    }\n}\n\n//go:noinline\nfunc allocStruct2() *struct2 {\n    return &struct2{}\n}\n\n由于 struct subStruct 不包含任何指针，因此它存储在一个专用于对象的范围中，而不引用其他对象：\n\n这使得垃圾回收器的工作更容易，因为它在标记内存时不必扫描这个范围。\n一旦分配完成，我们的程序就会强制垃圾回收器运行一个周期。以下是工作流程：\n\n垃圾回收器从堆栈开始标记，然后跟着指针递归遍历内存。直到对象都被标记时停止扫描。然而，这个过程不是在同一个 goroutine 中完成的\n完成的；每个指针都在工作池中排队。然后 ，后台的标记线程发现之前的出列队列是来自该工作池，扫描对象，然后将在其中找到的指针加入队列：\n\n着色!\n后台线程现在需要一种方法来跟踪哪些内存有没有被扫描。垃圾回收器使用三色算法，其工作原理如下：\n所有对象一开始都被认为是白色的\n\n\n根对象（堆栈、堆、全局变量）将以灰色显示\n\n\n\n完成此主要步骤后，垃圾回收器将：\n选择一个灰色的对象，把它涂成黑色\n\n\n遵循此对象的所有指针并将所有引用的对象涂成灰色\n\n\n\n然后，它将重复这两个步骤，直到没有更多的对象要着色。从这一点来看，对象不是黑色就是白色。白色集合表示未被任何其他对象引用且准备好回收的对象。\n下面是使用上一个示例对其进行的表示：\n\n作为第一种状态，所有对象都被视为白色。然后，对象被遍历，可到达的对象将变为灰色。如果对象位于标记为 “无扫描” 的范围内，则可以将其绘制为黑色，因为不需要对其进行扫描：\n\n灰色对象现在入队等待扫描并变黑：\n\n在没有更多的对象要处理之前，入队的对象也会发生同样的情况：\n\n在进程结束时，黑色对象是内存中正在使用的对象，而白色对象是要回收的对象。如我们所见，由于 struct2 的实例是在匿名函数中创建的，并且无法从堆栈访问，因此它保持为白色，可以清除。\n由于每个跨度中有一个名为 gcmarkBits 的位图属性，颜色在内部实现，该属性跟踪扫描，并将相应的位设置为 1：\n\n正如我们所见，黑色和灰色的工作原理是一样的。这一过程的不同之处在于，当黑色对象结束扫描链时，灰色对象排队等待扫描。\n垃圾回收器最终会 stops the world，将每个写屏障上所做的更改刷新到工作池，并执行剩余的标记。\n您可以在我的文章Go:垃圾回收器如何监视您的应用程序 中找到有关并发进程和垃圾回收器中标记阶段的更多详细信息\n运行时分析器\nGo 提供的工具允许我们可视化所有这些步骤，并在程序中查看垃圾回收器的影响。在启用跟踪的情况下运行我们的代码提供了前面步骤的一个大图。以下是 traces：\n\n标记线程的生命周期也可以在 goroutine 级别的 tracer 中可视化。下面是 goroutine#33 的示例，它在开始标记内存之前先在后台等待。",

          "description": "这篇文章将描述代码中经常使用的抢占式接口模式，以及为什么我认为在 Go 中遵循这种模式通常是不正确的。\n什么是抢占式接口\n接口是一种描述行为的方式，存在于大多数类型语言中。抢占式接口是指开发人员在实际需要出现之前对接口进行编码。一个示例可能如下所示。\ntype Auth interface {\n  GetUser() (User, error)\n}\n\ntype authImpl struct {\n  // ...\n}\nfunc NewAuth() Auth {\n  return &authImpl\n}\n\n抢占式接口何时有用\n抢占接口通常用于在 Java 中,并且大获成功，这是大部分程序员的想法。相信，很多 Go 开发者也是这么认为的。这种用法主要区别在于 Java 具有显式接口，而 Go 是隐式接口。让我们看一些示例 Java 代码，这些代码显示了如果不使用 Java 中的抢占式接口可能会出现的困难。\n// auth.java\npublic class Auth {\n  public boolean canAction() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n// logic.java\npublic class Logic {\n  public void takeAction(Auth a) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n现在假设您要更改 Logic 的 takeAction 方法中的参数 Auth 类型的对象，只要它具有 canAction() 方法即可。不幸的是，你不能。Auth 没有在其中实现带有 canAction() 的接口。你现在必须修改 Auth 为其提供一个接口，然后您可以在 takeAction 中接受该接口，或者将 Auth 包装在一个除了实现的方法之外什么都不做的类中。即使 logic.java 定义了一个 Auth 接口以在 takeAction() 中接受，也可能很难让 Auth 实现该接口。您可能无权修改 Auth，或者 Auth 可能位于第三方库中。也许 Auth 的作者不同意你的修改。也许在代码库中与同事共享 Auth，现在需要在修改之前达成共识。这是希望的 Java 代码。\n// auth.java\npublic interface Auth {\n  public boolean canAction()\n}\n// authimpl.java\nclass AuthImpl implements Auth {\n}\n// logic.java\npublic class Logic {\n  public void takeAction(Auth a) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n如果 Auth 的作者最初编码并返回一个接口，那么你在尝试扩展 takeAction 时，永远不会遇到问题。它自然适用于任何 Auth 接口。在具有显式接口的语言中，以后你会感谢过去的自己使用了抢占式接口。\n为什么这在 Go 中不是问题\n让我们在 Go 中设置相同的情况。\n// auth.go \ntype Auth struct { \n// ... \n}\n// logic.go \nfunc TakeAction(a *Auth) { \n  // ... \n}\n\n如果 logic 想要使 TakeAction 通用，则 logic 所有者可以单方面执行此操作，而不会打扰其他人。\n// logic.go \ntype LogicAuth interface { \n  CanAction() bool \n}\nfunc TakeAction(a LogicAuth) { \n  // ... \n}\n\n请注意 auth.go 不需要更改。这是使抢占式接口不再需要的关键所在。\nGo 中抢占式接口的意外副作用\nGo 的接口定义都是很小，但很强大。在标准库中，大多数接口定义都是单一方法。这允许最大的重用，因为实现接口很容易。当程序员对像上面的 Auth 这样的抢占式接口进行编码时，接口的方法数量往往会激增，这使得接口（可交换实现）的全部意义更难以实现。\nGo 中接口的最佳用法\nGo 的一个很好的经验法则是 - 接受接口，返回结构体。接受接口为您的 API 提供了最大的灵活性，返回结构体允许调用者快速导航到正确的函数。\n即使你的 Go 代码接受结构体并返回结构体以启动，隐式接口也允许您稍后扩展你的 API，而不会破坏向后兼容性。接口是一种抽象，抽象有时很有用。然而，不必要的抽象会造成不必要的复杂化。在需要之前不要使代码过于复杂。",

          "description": "作者：赵禹光，Seata Contributor，SkyWalking PMC\n​\n背景前序\n​\n\n正如所看到的文章题目，就在此时，Seata 与 SkyWalking 两个生态融合,取得了阶段性成果。下面就结合文章内容，给你徐徐道来。\n​\n事情的起因是这样的，Seata、SkyWalking 分别是分布式事务领域、一站式 APM 领域的的佼佼者，这一点通过 Github Star 排名就可以知道，也就不再赘述了。所以早在 2019 年，Seata 的用户就提出了使用 SkyWalking 观测的诉求。\n​\nSeata 融入 SkyWalking 监控后，就有了 APM 特性，用户在定位 Seata 分布式事务的问题时，可以通过分布式链路、机器指标、日志内容等多个维度进行问题剖析，实现定位问题的提效。\n​\n那结合这个诉求，两个社区感兴趣的同学就开始展开了初步讨论和实践，但是由于当时 Seata 的传输协议中，没有类似于 HTTP Header 的面向传输的消息头部，所以实现的第一版虽然实现了监控观测，但是兼容性非常不友好，这在解决分布式事务的监控中，显然是有欠缺的。故此，我们开启了二番讨论，结论是兼容性的前置条件是必须的，所以，Seata 要实现传输协议升级，就此 Seata 将此事放在了 RoadMap 中。SkyWalking 社区这边也暂时搁置了这件事。\n​\n时光荏苒，转眼 1 年多就过去了，Seata 社区在过程中已经完成了传输协议的升级，那我们就重启此事。\n​\n一、Seata 接入 SkyWalking 后，用户得到了什么\n​\n\n背景已经叙述完了，由于时间有些久，可能大家对两个生态融合之后带来的效果，也不是很清晰了，这里就我的个人的理解，介绍下两个生态融合后，给用户带来的益处：\n​\nSeata 的性能可被更好的观测:\n​\n\n我看到很多 Seata 分享的时候都有用户提问，Seata 性能消耗数据，因为分布式事务的性能消耗与场景关系非常大，所以用户通过 SkyWalking 可以更简单的观测自己的场景，自己给自己答案。\n​\n分布式事务执行过程有痕迹\n​\n\n在 AT 模式下，Seata 通过面向传输的消息头部，传递全局事务 XID ，全局事务执行完成后，每个在 DB 中的执行过程都会被清理掉，这在回溯执行过程的时候非常不友好，这些海量数据 Seata 可不会存储，这严重增加分布式事务关联数据库表的空间，带来不必要的性能消耗。所以两个生态融合后，SkyWalking 相关的数据库监控，就可以记录这些执行过程的海量数据。\n​\n定位问题的提效\n在日志中打印 XID 的同时打印 TraceId ，当出现问题想回溯 XID 相关联的全局链路时，在 SkyWalking 的展示端输入 TraceId 即可，通过 Seata 整体监控融入 SkyWalking ，不仅拥有全链路领域的监控，还在仪表盘、拓扑图、在线剖析和报警都得到了监控。\n​\n入门 Seata 提高一个维度\n​\n\n分布式事务一直被炒得很热，但真正能在市场上落地的也只有 Seata ，所以 Seata 并没有开源的学习范本，所以快速带领大家入门的资料也比较少。而且 Seata 有 3 个角色、4 种经典模式，可以多种组合，综上所诉，不由得让使用者云里雾里，两个生态融合后，用户可以清晰从上帝 (监控) 知道 Seata 的执行过程，进而透析工作原理。\n​\n二、典型 AT 模式监控场景\n​\n\n下面就官方 AT 模式的 Demo ，展示下接入后的 APM 特性。\n​\n官方描述的 ToC 交易场景\n用户请求交易服务\n交易服务锁定库存\n交易服务创建账单\n账单服务进行扣款\n​\n\n\n当 Seata 与 SkyWalking 融合后，场景复原\n\n全局事务正常链路描述\n​\n\n\n\n​\n全局事务异常链路描述\n​\n\n\n\n​\n用户手册\n官网\nSkyWalking APM: \nhttp://seata.io/zh-cn/docs/user/apm/skywalking.html\n常用链接\nSeata:  https://github.com/seata/seata\nSamples:  https://github.com/seata/seata-samples\nRelease:  https://github.com/seata/seata/releases\n官网:  https://seata.io\n​\n投稿\n欢迎大家将 Seata 相关的实践文章投稿至：slievrly@gmail.com\n​",
