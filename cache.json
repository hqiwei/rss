          "description": "最初如何与 go 结识的？在此之前，有无接触过其他语言？谈谈他们的优缺点。\n在创业公司工作的时候，看到一个信息检索模块是 Go 写的，当时主要写 PHP，也稍微写过一点 C，被 Go 简单直白的语法和高效的并发编程震撼到了。后来跳槽到滴滴就找机会慢慢从 PHP 转 Go 了。刚毕业的时候其实是从 C 开始写的，被 void * 和 callback hell 折磨得死去活来，就投向了 PHP 的怀抱，结果发现 PHP 在大公司有很多大项目，几十万行代码，一样非常难维护，那些几千行代码的接口连顺畅地读下来都很难，改起来同样也很心虚。转了 Go 以后，基本没这种烦恼了，几乎所有的项目读代码都很轻松，也很开心。\nGo 语言中最看好哪种特性，谈一谈理由以及你希望它改进的方面\n泛型，找再多不需要泛型的理由，你还是无法在没有泛型的前提下既保证代码重复少，又能做到类型安全。泛型到位之后，至少大家写一些复杂的数据结构库能轻松很多，以前的这些库是复制粘贴断言漫天飞的。希望的改进：个人现在最希望改进的是 if err != nil。。造成了太多的代码重复，但是也不喜欢官方之前那个 try 方案，像某语言那样的问号操作符不就挺好的。要是能支持注解的话，做语言本身的扩展会方便很多 (这一条感觉官方应该不太会考虑)\nGo 语言对大厂和创业公司来说分别有什么优越性？\n大厂：对延迟敏感的业务 (如高频交易、广告) 是少数，Go 对于 80% 的业务是适用的。大厂的单模块代码量都非常非常多 (很多都 10w 行起了)，相比 PHP 和 Python，这种规模的项目用 Go 写，就是好维护。当前使用 Java 的公司在上云后碰到了很多水土不服的问题，为了解决这些问题又需要付出更多技术上的努力 (再说下去这段就不能播了)。用 Go 上云还是比较省心的。\n创业公司：买公有云是按用量算钱的，用的资源少就是省钱。就是这么现实。\nGo 有没有帮助解决公司的实际问题？\nGo 在工程化上做了很多努力\n研发效率不好说，大家都有一些常见的代码生成工具的话，其实差不多，但强类型语言，在项目中后期维护阶段，肯定比那些 array 满天飞的强\n官方直接把 parser 对用户开放，做 linter 不要太方便，工程效率部门直接将 golangci-lint 拿到公司内再针对业务场景做一些定制的 linter 就可以用起来了。\n运维不用再考虑我给哪个业务用 PHP x.y 版本的问题了\n印象中某公司说从 PHP 迁移到 Go，能节省至少一半服务器吧 (这句是传说，我没验证过，各位 PHP fan 不要生气\n\n\n对众多大厂转 Go 提一些建议吧，在选型上 Go 语言适用什么场景，不适用什么场景？\n\n\n\n延迟敏感 (广告、高频交易) 类的场景用 Go 不合适，集中式的并发极高 (几 w QPS) 的网关系统用 Go 不合适，大数据场景 (已经有现成的 Java/Scala SDK，Go 什么库都没有的那种) 不适用。虽然一般会讲 go 的 stw 已经控制在个位数毫秒以内了，但实际请求的延迟不只受 stw 影响，所以在 POC 阶段也应该自己做一些压测和数据验证。除了上面讲的，80% 的其它场景问题不大。\n谈一谈 Go 的未来，将在哪些领域有更深的应用\nGo 现在其实已经是后端服务、分布式基础组件、运维相关领域的主流语言了。个人倾向上希望能在泛型出现后能在数据领域 (如实时计算) 上稍微有一些拓展，但感觉可能比较难。\n介绍下本次分享的议题吧\n这次分享是 Go1.14 的信号式抢占，之前看了作者在 GopherCon 上的分享，只是介绍了一些概念，相信完全没有满足大家的好奇心，这次我们就来详细看看这个东西到底是怎么实现的。\n分享一下如何快速掌握一门新的编程语言，分享一些经验给新 gopher 吧。学习 go 的最佳实践是什么? 推荐一些书吧！\n要多动手，多抄代码。比如看《The Go Programming Language》，能把书上所有的例子都抄明白，那就已经入门了。入门以后，尽量结合工作多写项目。还是从实践中学习最靠谱。要是你对 cgo 啊，汇编什么的感兴趣，欢迎买柴老板和我合著的《Go 语言高级编程》呀。其它的书，就买最畅销的就完事了！\n你是第几次参加 GopherChina，对 GopherChina 大会有何期待?\n应该是第三还是第四次了，希望以后 GopherChina 能一直保持技术和应用两类主题并重，不要变成架构师大会 (笑",

          "description": "前言\n群里老有同学问，go-zero 的 数据库 和 redis 库是否有连接池支持。先说结论：有的，可以放心大胆用！\n从框架设计来说，对于数据库连接这种资源当然是尽可能减少频繁操作：\n为业务减负\n提升框架自身的性能\n池化技术是一个通用化技术，本身就应该作为一个通用库支撑框架的上层业务\n所以不管是 sqlx，redis，以及 mongo，等以后可能要支持的数据源类型，底层的池化处理都是通用的；所以当开发者需要一个池化处理组件时，go-zero 也是提供的。\n池化技术支持的库就位于：core/resourcemanager.go。下面来看看这个库的使用～～\n使用\n使用的话，我们直接来看 sqlx ，它是怎么用的：\n// 1. 初始化\nvar connManager = syncx.NewResourceManager()\n\nfunc getCachedSqlConn(driverName, server string) (*db, error) {\n  val, err := connManager.GetResource(server, func() (io.Closer, error) {\n    // 2. 此处才是真正创建连接的地方\n    conn, err := newDBConnection(driverName, server)\n    ...\n    // 3. 将连接返回给连接池【内部也肯定是存起来】\n    return &db{\n      DB: conn,\n    }, nil\n  })\n  ...\n  return val.(*db), nil\n}\n\n说说其中的要点：\nNewResourceManager：创建一个池子\nGetResource(key, createFunc)：key 是用来防止并发获取资源时重复请求，createFunc 才是正在用来创建资源的函数【此函数需要有开发者自己编写符合业务需求资源】\n总结一下资源池的模型：\n// 1. new\nvar manager = NewResourceManager()\n\n// 2. 业务资源获取函数\nfunc getResource(key string) (*resource, error) {\n  return manager.GetResource(key, createFunc);\n}\n\n// 3.业务资源创建函数【由开发者自己编写，此处只是一个样例】\nfunc createFunc() (io.Closer, error) {\n  // 打开一个资源\n  conn, err := openResource();\n  // 设置一下资源配置\n  conn.setConfig()\n\n  return conn, err;\n}\n\n整体分析\n\n其实流程上很简单，其中还有我们老生常谈的 sharedCalls：\nGetResource，携带特定的 key，到资源池中的 map 中查找：\n\n\n查到了，直接返回\n没有查到，调用传入的 create() ；此处才真正创建一个真实的资源连接，并放入 map\n\n\n\n其中对 map 的查询和写入，都得加锁。\n其中在对资源池进行操作时，附加上 sharedCalls ：防止并发请求时无效流量请求以及共享请求结果。\n关于 SharedCalls，还不清楚的同学，可以到 go-zero 官方文档中仔细查看。\n总结\n本篇文章对 go-zero 的资源池库从使用到结构进行了分析。大家也可以在业务中常发生资源申请的逻辑处，加上 resourcemanager，本质上也是给资源加上一个缓存，节省反复创建。\n关于 go-zero 更多的设计和实现文章，可以关注『微服务实践』公众号。\n项目地址\nhttps://github.com/tal-tech/go-zero\n欢迎使用 go-zero 并 star 支持我们！\n微信交流群\n关注『微服务实践』公众号并点击 交流群 获取社区群二维码。",
