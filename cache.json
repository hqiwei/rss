          "description": "前言\n群里老有同学问，go-zero 的 数据库 和 redis 库是否有连接池支持。先说结论：有的，可以放心大胆用！\n从框架设计来说，对于数据库连接这种资源当然是尽可能减少频繁操作：\n为业务减负\n提升框架自身的性能\n池化技术是一个通用化技术，本身就应该作为一个通用库支撑框架的上层业务\n所以不管是 sqlx，redis，以及 mongo，等以后可能要支持的数据源类型，底层的池化处理都是通用的；所以当开发者需要一个池化处理组件时，go-zero 也是提供的。\n池化技术支持的库就位于：core/resourcemanager.go。下面来看看这个库的使用～～\n使用\n使用的话，我们直接来看 sqlx ，它是怎么用的：\n// 1. 初始化\nvar connManager = syncx.NewResourceManager()\n\nfunc getCachedSqlConn(driverName, server string) (*db, error) {\n  val, err := connManager.GetResource(server, func() (io.Closer, error) {\n    // 2. 此处才是真正创建连接的地方\n    conn, err := newDBConnection(driverName, server)\n    ...\n    // 3. 将连接返回给连接池【内部也肯定是存起来】\n    return &db{\n      DB: conn,\n    }, nil\n  })\n  ...\n  return val.(*db), nil\n}\n\n说说其中的要点：\nNewResourceManager：创建一个池子\nGetResource(key, createFunc)：key 是用来防止并发获取资源时重复请求，createFunc 才是正在用来创建资源的函数【此函数需要有开发者自己编写符合业务需求资源】\n总结一下资源池的模型：\n// 1. new\nvar manager = NewResourceManager()\n\n// 2. 业务资源获取函数\nfunc getResource(key string) (*resource, error) {\n  return manager.GetResource(key, createFunc);\n}\n\n// 3.业务资源创建函数【由开发者自己编写，此处只是一个样例】\nfunc createFunc() (io.Closer, error) {\n  // 打开一个资源\n  conn, err := openResource();\n  // 设置一下资源配置\n  conn.setConfig()\n\n  return conn, err;\n}\n\n整体分析\n\n其实流程上很简单，其中还有我们老生常谈的 sharedCalls：\nGetResource，携带特定的 key，到资源池中的 map 中查找：\n\n\n查到了，直接返回\n没有查到，调用传入的 create() ；此处才真正创建一个真实的资源连接，并放入 map\n\n\n\n其中对 map 的查询和写入，都得加锁。\n其中在对资源池进行操作时，附加上 sharedCalls ：防止并发请求时无效流量请求以及共享请求结果。\n关于 SharedCalls，还不清楚的同学，可以到 go-zero 官方文档中仔细查看。\n总结\n本篇文章对 go-zero 的资源池库从使用到结构进行了分析。大家也可以在业务中常发生资源申请的逻辑处，加上 resourcemanager，本质上也是给资源加上一个缓存，节省反复创建。\n关于 go-zero 更多的设计和实现文章，可以关注『微服务实践』公众号。\n项目地址\nhttps://github.com/tal-tech/go-zero\n欢迎使用 go-zero 并 star 支持我们！\n微信交流群\n关注『微服务实践』公众号并点击 交流群 获取社区群二维码。",
